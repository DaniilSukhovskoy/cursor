# Definition of Done for UI features

A UI change is "done" only when:

- Desktop + mobile layouts behave as specified (explicit breakpoints if applicable)
- Interactive states are handled (hover/focus/active/disabled/loading if relevant)
- Accessibility basics:
  - keyboard reachable for interactive elements
  - focus not lost in overlays/panels
  - ESC closes overlays if expected
- No data calls from UI layer
- Domain logic remains pure (no DOM, no fetch)
- No input mutation / in-place state mutation
- SCSS follows strict BEM and doesn't increase specificity wars
