# Workflow

- Start by restating the task as a short spec + acceptance checklist (desktop + mobile).
- If there is no Figma or visual reference, ask ONLY the minimum questions required to remove ambiguity, then freeze the spec.
- Implement with the smallest diff possible. No unrelated refactors.
- After changes:
  - build must pass
  - lint must pass (if present)
  - basic manual smoke steps must be listed (what to click / what to verify)
- Finish with:
  - files changed
  - what to verify
  - any tradeoffs / risks
