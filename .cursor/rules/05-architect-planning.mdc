# Architect Planning

Use this when producing a frozen spec and implementation guidance.

- Keep hard quality rules unchanged (architecture layers, state immutability, SCSS, definition of done, QA workflow).
- Do not rewrite or duplicate strict rules inside agent outputs; reference relevant rule files.
- If requirements are ambiguous, ask only the minimum questions needed to freeze scope.
- Provide a concise plan with:
  - scope and explicit out-of-scope
  - acceptance checklist (desktop/mobile where relevant)
  - layer/component mapping
  - sequence of implementation steps
  - risks, tradeoffs, and rollback notes
- When meaningful tradeoffs exist, include 2 options and pick one with a short rationale.
- Prefer smallest-diff implementation path that satisfies all constraints.
