# SCSS rules (strict BEM)

- Use strict BEM for all new and modified UI:
  - Block: .component
  - Element: .component__part
  - Modifier: .component--variant, .component__part--state

- Keep specificity low:
  - Avoid deep nesting
  - Avoid styling by tag selectors inside blocks (no ".menu ul li a" chains)
  - Avoid global overrides unless explicitly approved

- Each UI component should have a clear SCSS ownership:
  - One block per component
  - Modifiers for variants/states
  - No cross-component styling (no reaching into other blocks)

- Do not introduce new global utility classes unless the project already uses a utility system.
- Prefer tokens (CSS variables) for spacing/colors if they exist; do not invent random one-offs.
